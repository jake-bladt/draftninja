# Learning TypeScript and Angular

This is a partial list of resources I've been using to learn TypeScript:

[TypeScript Fundamentals on PluralSite](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript/table-of-contents) - John Papa is an excellent teacher and he knows TypeScript well, but this video comes from the very early days when TypeScript was tightly coupled with Microsoft products and namespaces were still called modules. Still, this was my initial primary learning tool for TypeScript.

[TypeScript 2.x for Angular Developers on Safari Books Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/typescript-2x-for/9781786460554/5ef1b9ec-0f8c-49f8-88bf-a59a70bc22e2.xhtml) - This was a good gap filler for the Papa videos, but there are a stunning number of code-breaking typos in this book. I'm not sure it would have been useful as a first text.

[Learning Angular 7 on Safari Books Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/learning-angular-7/9781789804461/9781789804461-video1_4) - So far, a good walkthrough video on building an Angular project from the ground up. I'm currently about 20% of the way through it.
